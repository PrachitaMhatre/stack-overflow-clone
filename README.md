This is my Stack Overflow clone full-stack project which I developed during my Internship. I developed Stack Overflow Clone using JavaScript with Node.js and Express.js for the backend and jQuery, HTML, and CSS for the front end. By taking this course or project, I developed a familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript language. Understand the concepts commonly used in dynamic language programming. Become familiar with common libraries and tools that are used in web application development. Apply basic programming principles to the construction of websites. From this, I want to know how frontend and backend get connected, how workflow is going on, and many more.
